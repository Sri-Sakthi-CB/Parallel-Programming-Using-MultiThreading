# Parallel-Programming-Using-MultiThreading
- Parallel Programming Using MultiThreading that implements the parallel versions of simple Algorithms
- Here, This console based Application computes Matrix Multiplication and Merge Sort by parallelly computing and displaying the answers in both the console and the JPanel Layout.

### In Matrix Multiplication,
- The "number of Threads" is initially received as input through the JPanel UI
- The input values of Two matrices is received through the console and output is computed and displayed on both the console and JPanel layout parallelly.

### In Merge Sort,
- Thread count is received through the JPanel layout.
- The input size and input values to be sorted are inputed through the console
- The output is displayed on the JPanel layout
- The output is also parallelly displayed on the console with the demonstration of the thread separation.

## Tools Used: Intellij IDEA for Java
